note that doing "pip install" will not work since the pypi version is outdated
and drag the folder into the /Users/*USERNAME*/Library/Python/*VERSION*/lib/site-packages folder. (If you need help doing this, see this post: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/go-directly-to-a-specific-folder-on-mac-mchlp1236/

## Step 2:
Download or copy the logger.py file.

That's it! Have fun modifying this project!
